# MS2 Deliverable: Problem Analysis & Interview Structure

## 1. Selected Problems

[cite_start]This section lists the four problems selected by the group for the MS2 deliverable, as required by the course guidelines[cite: 116, 152].

1.  **QR-Based Order and Entry Management for Venues:** The administrative process for sales and entry at busy bars and events is inefficient, leading to long queues, operational bottlenecks, and a poor customer experience. This project aims to centralize operations through a mobile app where users order, pay, and receive a QR code for quick pickup or entry.

2.  **Local Event Discovery:** People often miss out on local events like concerts, festivals, or workshops because the information is scattered and not personalized. This problem focuses on creating a centralized platform that uses user interests and location to provide a tailored guide to local happenings.

3.  **University Parking Management:** Finding available parking at or near the university is a constant challenge. This problem addresses the need for a real-time system to check parking availability, potentially including features like indoor navigation to a specific spot or a virtual queue.

4.  **Sports Group Finder:** Students lack a dedicated platform to connect with others for sports activities. This hinders community building and makes it difficult to organize games or training sessions, relying mostly on word-of-mouth.

## 2.1 Interview Structure (Andrés Caballero)

This document outlines the interview structure for the primary problem: **QR-Based Order and Entry Management for Venues**. [cite_start]The structure includes questions and their specific purpose to guide the conversation and gather valuable insights, as required for the deliverable[cite: 154, 155].

**Interview Title:** Exploring the Purchase and Operational Experience at Bars and Events.
**Interviewer:** Andrés Caballero
**General Objective:** To deeply understand the processes, frustrations, and needs of customers and staff during the purchase of drinks, food, or tickets in a high-traffic environment to validate the need for a digital solution.

### A. Introduction & Warm-up (5 minutes)
* **Purpose:** To build rapport, establish a comfortable atmosphere, and understand the interviewee's general context.

| Question | Purpose of the Question |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. To start, could you tell me a bit about yourself? (If a customer: How often do you come here or to similar places? If staff: What is your role, and how long have you been working here?) | To understand the interviewee's profile and their level of experience with the problem's environment. |
| 2. Can you describe a typical weekend night at this venue from your perspective? What words would you use to describe the atmosphere? | To set the scene and evoke the emotions and sensations associated with the experience. |

### B. Problem Exploration & Current Process (15 minutes)
* **Purpose:** To map the current user journey and identify specific friction points, delays, and frustrations.

| Question | Purpose of the Question |
| :--- | :--- |
| 3. Can you walk me through the step-by-step process, from the moment you decide you want to buy something (a drink, a ticket) until you have it? | To map the "happy path" and the steps of the current process to visualize the user/operator journey. |
| 4. What would you say is the slowest or most frustrating part of that entire process? Why? | To identify the main "pain points" or bottlenecks from the interviewee's perspective. |
| 5. Have you ever had an issue with an order (it was wrong, took too long, payment problems)? Could you tell me about it? | To collect specific anecdotes that reveal hidden problems or the consequences of current inefficiencies. |
| 6. **(For Staff/Admin)** How do you manage peak demand? What tools, if any, do you currently use to manage orders and payments? | To understand the operational challenges and the limitations of current tools (or the lack thereof). |

### C. Proposed Solution Validation (10 minutes)
* **Purpose:** To neutrally introduce the core concept of the solution and gather initial reactions, ideas, and potential barriers to adoption.

| Question | Purpose of the Question |
| :--- | :--- |
| 7. Imagine a system where you could use your phone to see the menu, order, pay, and receive a QR code. Then, you'd just go to a pickup point, show the code, and get your order without the traditional queue. What’s the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear that? | To get an initial, unbiased reaction to the core value proposition. |
| 8. What benefits do you think a system like this could have? And what drawbacks or problems would you be concerned about (e.g., payment security, people cutting the line, tech failures)? | To identify perceived benefits (for marketing) and barriers/concerns (to be solved in the design phase). |
| 9. How comfortable would you be using a system like this to pay? Is there any feature you would consider essential? | To gauge the willingness for tech adoption and capture key functional requirements from the user's perspective. |

### D. Closing (5 minutes)
* **Purpose:** To thank the interviewee and leave the door open for future collaboration.

| Question | Purpose of the Question |
| :--- | :--- |
| 10. To wrap up, is there anything else you think is important for me to know about this topic, or anything I haven't asked? | To capture any valuable information that might have been missed during the structured part of the interview. |
| 11. Thank you so much for your time. We are developing a solution for this—would you be open to being contacted in the future to test a prototype? | To show gratitude and validate the interviewee's interest in becoming an early adopter for future usability testing. |
