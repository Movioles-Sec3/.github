**Mateo:** Hi, before we start, do I have your permission to record this interview for my university project?
**Gladys:** Of course – go ahead.

### **Section 1 – Introduction & Context**

**Mateo:** Can you tell me your name and what you do?
**Gladys:** My name is Gladys Monsalve. I graduated as a chemical engineer and currently I work as Head of the Integrated Operational Risk Management Department at Ecopetrol´s Barrancabermeja refinery.

**Mateo:** Do you usually attend bars, concerts, or live events?
**Gladys:** Sometimes, not too often if I'm honest.

**Mateo:** Could you describe your most recent experience ordering food, drinks, or entering an event?
**Gladys:** A couple of weeks ago, my husband and children went to a restaurant that specializes in buffalo meat. The location is very central, but parking is difficult to find. The street is busy, making it difficult to get to. The place is small but very well laid out, and we were able to find a table for the four of us even without a reservation. The service is excellent. The food is very tasty and served quickly. Overall, it was a good experience.

### **Section 2 – Identifying the Problem**

**Mateo:** When ordering at a busy event, what challenges do you usually face?
**Gladys:** In my case, I am very strict with meal times and sometimes if the place is very busy it turns out that they take a long time to serve, so I start to get uncomfortable both from hunger and from the discomfort in my stomach (because I suffer from gastritis).

**Mateo:** How do you usually handle the waiting time or the crowd when ordering or validating tickets?
**Gladys:** When I'm with my family or friends, we seek out fun conversations. Sometimes we play games, tell stories, reminisce about trips, and more. We avoid immersing ourselves in our phones.
When I'm alone, I try to read a book or just observe the surroundings. Sometimes it's fun.
In both cases, it's helpful to have drinks ready from the start.

**Mateo:** What’s the longest you’ve ever had to wait for an order or to get in? How did it make you feel?
**Gladys:** Several years ago, a large group of coworkers and I went to lunch. I was very hungry and we were short on time. For over 45 minutes, they served each plate to the other people, and my plate never arrived. It was already late, and we had to go back to work, so we left. On the way to work, I looked for an alternative to satisfy my hunger and left early that day. I felt very upset and frustrated. I never found out what had happened to my order, and the restaurant didn't give me an explanation.

### **Section 3 – What, How, Why Deep Dive**

**Mateo:** What part of the ordering or entry process do you think takes the most time?
**Gladys:** It depends on the location. In some restaurants, for instance, getting in takes a long time because they're in high demand and you have to wait in line for a long time, for example, Crepes & Waffles. In other cases, it takes a long time to get service.

**Mateo:** How do staff usually manage orders and payments in those situations?
**Gladys:** People are usually deeply affected by poor customer service, unjustified delays, etc. I generally look at them and put myself in their shoes. Serving others is a very demanding job, especially when there are a lot of people to serve.

**Mateo:** Why do you think these issues happen so often in crowded venues?
**Gladys:** I think not all businesses spend enough to have ample staff during peak hours and fewer staff during off-peak hours. This applies to all processes. Taking a restaurant as an example, it requires: staff to greet and seat customers, staff to take orders, staff to prepare, etc.

### **Section 4 – Exploring Solutions**

**Mateo:** If there was an app where you could order and pay in advance, receiving a QR code for pickup, how would you feel about using it?
**Gladys:** I'd really like an app that provides that service. I think it would also make me feel good to have a restaurant where someone is already waiting for me, takes me to the table I requested, and serves the food I selected within a few minutes. It's a great idea.

**Mateo:** What features would make you trust and actually use such an app during a live event?
**Gladys:** That it's a reliable platform, that the payment method is secure, that it's highly rated by other customers, things like that. Maybe I'd be a bit wary at first, but I'd try something small to start, and then I'd become a customer of that app.

**Mateo:** Do you see any downsides or risks to using a digital ordering and pickup system?
**Gladys:** Everything has risks, but I think they need to be managed. Security issues must be considered, including the security of digital payments. And some ordering issues, since the app must be very clear in its offering so that the order delivered is what the customer really wants.

### **Section 5 – Closing**

**Mateo:** Is there anything else you’d like to share about your experiences or ideas for improving ordering at events?
**Gladys:** I think the app should be fun, very intuitive, and take into account all the options. It could also recognize frequent customers and take their past orders into account to help with new orders. It could also make suggestions. In short, I think something like this lends itself to many creative ideas.

**Mateo:** Thanks for your time — this will be very helpful for our project.
**Gladys:** It was a pleasure.
