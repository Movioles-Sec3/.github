# MS2 Deliverable: Problem Analysis & Interview Structure

## 1. Selected Problems

[cite_start]This section lists the four problems selected by the group for the MS2 deliverable, as required by the course guidelines[cite: 116, 152].

1.  **QR-Based Order and Entry Management for Venues:** The administrative process for sales and entry at busy bars and events is inefficient, leading to long queues, operational bottlenecks, and a poor customer experience. This project aims to centralize operations through a mobile app where users order, pay, and receive a QR code for quick pickup or entry.

2.  **Local Event Discovery:** People often miss out on local events like concerts, festivals, or workshops because the information is scattered and not personalized. This problem focuses on creating a centralized platform that uses user interests and location to provide a tailored guide to local happenings.

3.  **University Parking Management:** Finding available parking at or near the university is a constant challenge. This problem addresses the need for a real-time system to check parking availability, potentially including features like indoor navigation to a specific spot or a virtual queue.

4.  **Sports Group Finder:** Students lack a dedicated platform to connect with others for sports activities. This hinders community building and makes it difficult to organize games or training sessions, relying mostly on word-of-mouth.

## 2.1 Interview Structure (Andrés Caballero)

This document outlines the interview structure for the primary problem: **QR-Based Order and Entry Management for Venues**. [cite_start]The structure includes questions and their specific purpose to guide the conversation and gather valuable insights, as required for the deliverable[cite: 154, 155].

**Interview Title:** Exploring the Purchase and Operational Experience at Bars and Events.
**Interviewer:** Andrés Caballero
**General Objective:** To deeply understand the processes, frustrations, and needs of customers and staff during the purchase of drinks, food, or tickets in a high-traffic environment to validate the need for a digital solution.

### Introduction & Warm-up
* **Purpose:** To build rapport, establish a comfortable atmosphere, and understand the interviewee's general context.

| Question | Purpose of the Question |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. To start, could you tell me a bit about yourself? (If a customer: How often do you come here or to similar places? If staff: What is your role, and how long have you been working here?) | To understand the interviewee's profile and their level of experience with the problem's environment. |
| 2. Can you describe a typical weekend night at this venue from your perspective? What words would you use to describe the atmosphere? | To set the scene and evoke the emotions and sensations associated with the experience. |

### Problem Exploration & Current Process (15 minutes)
* **Purpose:** To map the current user journey and identify specific friction points, delays, and frustrations.

| Question | Purpose of the Question |
| :--- | :--- |
| 3. Can you walk me through the step-by-step process, from the moment you decide you want to buy something (a drink, a ticket) until you have it? | To map the "happy path" and the steps of the current process to visualize the user/operator journey. |
| 4. What would you say is the slowest or most frustrating part of that entire process? Why? | To identify the main "pain points" or bottlenecks from the interviewee's perspective. |
| 5. Have you ever had an issue with an order (it was wrong, took too long, payment problems)? Could you tell me about it? | To collect specific anecdotes that reveal hidden problems or the consequences of current inefficiencies. |
| 6. **(For Staff/Admin)** How do you manage peak demand? What tools, if any, do you currently use to manage orders and payments? | To understand the operational challenges and the limitations of current tools (or the lack thereof). |

### Proposed Solution Validation
* **Purpose:** To neutrally introduce the core concept of the solution and gather initial reactions, ideas, and potential barriers to adoption.

| Question | Purpose of the Question |
| :--- | :--- |
| 7. Imagine a system where you could use your phone to see the menu, order, pay, and receive a QR code. Then, you'd just go to a pickup point, show the code, and get your order without the traditional queue. What’s the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear that? | To get an initial, unbiased reaction to the core value proposition. |
| 8. What benefits do you think a system like this could have? And what drawbacks or problems would you be concerned about (e.g., payment security, people cutting the line, tech failures)? | To identify perceived benefits (for marketing) and barriers/concerns (to be solved in the design phase). |
| 9. How comfortable would you be using a system like this to pay? Is there any feature you would consider essential? | To gauge the willingness for tech adoption and capture key functional requirements from the user's perspective. |

## 3. Audio Summary and Interviews

### 3.1 Interview (Andrés Caballero)

[Interview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JahLlELKOkR9F62m5CSC5IhyWWkDyd4Z/view?usp=sharing)

**Interviewer:** Andrés Caballero
**Interviewee:** Juan Diego (Frequent Customer)

**Andrés:** Hello Juan Diego, thank you so much for giving us a few minutes. My name is Andrés Caballero, I'm a Systems Engineering student at the Universidad de los Andes, and my team and I are working on a project for the mobile application development course. Our goal is to understand how we could improve the experience at bars and events, for both customers and staff. Your perspective as a frequent customer is super valuable to us. We'd like to talk for about 5 to 10 minutes about your experiences. There are no right or wrong answers; we're only interested in your sincere and honest opinion. Importantly, to not miss any details, would you be okay with me recording the audio of our conversation? It's for academic use by my team only and will be completely confidential.

**Juan Diego:** Good day, Andrés. I give you my consent to use the information I'm about to provide for your research project.

**Andrés:** Thank you very much. So, to begin, I'd like to know if you could tell me a bit about yourself. If you're a customer, how often do you come to places like this? Do you have any related employment, or what would you say is your role and how long have you been frequenting these places?

**Juan Diego:** Well, you could say I'm a frequent customer of a salsa bar, mostly on Fridays. I've been going to this place for about a year and a half, and I mostly go between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m.

**Andrés:** Thanks. Now I'd like us to focus on what things are like on a busy night, like a Friday or Saturday night, as you were saying. Could you describe the step-by-step process, from the moment you decide you want to buy something—a drink, food, whatever—until you have it in your hands?

**Juan Diego:** Well, the process to get food and drinks in this place is a bit complex because it's a place with very loud sound. So, when you get to the bar and order, say, a juice, a water, a Gatorade—because this place is for dancing—you have to shout a lot, and when you leave, your vocal cords feel completely worn out. So, it's very difficult, especially since my voice is a bit deep and in places like this, it can't be heard at all.

**Andrés:** What you mention is very interesting. I'd like to know about your experience buying liquor, from a whiskey to a rum, in a bar like this, where the lines can get really crowded and are very long, with many people ordering at the same time. How would you describe this experience?

**Juan Diego:** Well, I'd describe the experience as a bit frustrating because it's really like, either I get up to order and my table gets stolen, or I get up to order and my things get stolen. So, I don't know, the situation is a bit complex. It almost forces me to go out with people I know, and when it's time to order, it's like, okay, what do you want? I place my order, and the person at the bar charges me right there, but I feel like there could be better ways.

**Andrés:** I perfectly understand the challenges. Now I want to change the subject a bit and present you with an idea. It's not something that exists; it's just a concept we're exploring. Imagine for a moment that you could use your phone to see the menu, order, and pay directly from your table or wherever you are at the event. Once you pay, the application generates a unique QR code. With that code, you go to a quick pickup area, show it, and they give you your order, without having to wait in the traditional line at the bar. When you hear that idea, what's the first thing that comes to your mind?

**Juan Diego:** The first thing that comes to my mind is that a waiter won't be as necessary anymore.

**Andrés:** Okay, what benefits or advantages do you think a system like that could have?

**Juan Diego:** Well, I'd say the advantages are that it would help with the security issue I mentioned regarding my belongings, and also I wouldn't have to strain my voice shouting what I want. It would save me time and even the effort of getting to the bar and skipping those annoying lines that usually form.

**Andrés:** And on the other hand, what disadvantages or problems would you worry about when using this type of concept or application?

**Juan Diego:** Well, the disadvantage would be the connection, I mean, the data internet or even if there's a signal in the place, because these places are usually very isolated, and you almost have to go outside to get a bit of signal.

**Andrés:** If you were to use something like this, is there any feature that would be absolutely essential for you?

**Juan Diego:** Maybe that it could connect to the local network, even though that implies greater security risks, but it would facilitate access.

**Andrés:** We're almost done. Thank you so much for your time. Before we wrap up, I'd like to know, is there anything else you think is important for me to know about this topic that I might not have asked?

**Juan Diego:** No, I feel we've covered all the bases, all the points, and based on my experiences, I believe that's all for now.

**Andrés:** Really, Juan Diego, thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experience. You've helped us a lot with your information as a frequent customer. We are in the early stages of this project. If we move forward, would you be interested in us contacting you later to show you a prototype and get your opinion?

**Juan Diego:** Yes, honestly, I'd really like to see what innovative ideas you have, how you're going to apply them, and I also feel it would be useful, like those methodologies of asking customers what they need to improve the service.

**Andrés:** Perfect, thank you again and have a great day.

**Juan Diego:** Thanks to you for this.

## 4. "What/How/Why" Situations per Interview

### 4.1 "What/How/Why" Situations (Andrés Caballero)

Based on the interview, the following four key situations were identified that reveal the user's frustrations and needs.

| Situation | What is happening? | How are they doing it? | Why is this happening? | Who is the user? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. The Shout at the Bar** | A customer tries to order a drink at a salsa bar with loud music. | He is forcing his voice and shouting for the bartender to hear him. He mentions his voice is deep and can barely be heard, ending up with "totally worn out" vocal cords. | The venue's atmosphere, designed for dancing, creates an acoustic communication barrier that turns a simple transaction into a physically exhausting effort. | A frequent customer who enjoys the bar's main activity (dancing) but suffers through a secondary yet essential process (ordering). |
| **2. The Table Dilemma**| A customer hesitates to go to the bar to order, weighing the risk of leaving their belongings and table unattended. | He expresses a sense of frustration and complexity, feeling he has to choose between ordering something or risking his table or things being stolen. | The venue's dynamics (crowded, little personal oversight) create an insecure environment. This forces him to depend on going with company so someone can watch their spot. | A customer who feels vulnerable and whose autonomy is limited by the insecure environment, generating anxiety around a simple purchase. |
| **3. The Technology Barrier** | A customer identifies a critical point of failure in the idea of an app for ordering at the bar. | Immediately and confidently, he points out that the internet connection or data signal is usually very poor or non-existent in those places, as they are "very isolated". | His past experience has taught him that digital solutions depend on an infrastructure that often fails in these specific contexts, leading him to anticipate the app's failure. | A user with practical tech knowledge who not only identifies problems but also suggests solutions (using a local network), demonstrating a deep analysis of the context. |
| **4. The Reaction to the Solution** | A customer processes the idea of a QR app, and his first thought is about the impact on the bar's staff. | His initial reaction is not about his own benefit, but an analytical observation: "a waiter won't be as necessary anymore". | His mental model of how a bar operates makes him first consider the operational and staffing implications before the personal convenience the solution would offer. | A pragmatic user who, when evaluating a new technology, considers the impact on the entire system, revealing that customers also think about the business's viability. |

## 5. Customer Journey Map: "Ordering a Drink in a Crowded Bar"

This map visualizes a generic customer's process when buying a drink in a crowded bar, following the guide's format.

* **Persona:** A customer in a crowded bar or event.
* **Scenario:** A weekend night, the place is full, and the music is loud.
* **Goal:** To buy a drink.

| Stage of Journey | Activities | Feelings and Needs | Opportunities for Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Decision to Order** | The customer decides they want a drink. | **Positive 🙂.** <br> *Needs something to drink to keep enjoying themselves.* | - |
| **2. Dilemma and Planning** | They observe the crowd at the bar. They worry about leaving their table and belongings unattended. | **Negative 😠.** <br> *Feels anxious and insecure. Needs a way to order without abandoning their safe space.* | - **Eliminate the need to leave the table.** <br> - **Create a secure ordering method that doesn't compromise the safety of their belongings.** |
| **3. Approaching the Bar** | They make their way through the crowd to get to a spot where they can be seen by the staff. | **Negative 😒.** <br> *Feels uncomfortable and frustrated by the physical movement.* | - **Reduce contact and unnecessary movement.** |
| **4. Placing the Order** | They try to get the bartender's attention. They shout their order over the music, repeating it several times. | **Very Negative 😫.** <br> *Feels stressed and vocally exhausted. This is the lowest point of the experience.* | - **Create a clear and silent communication channel.** <br> - **Ensure order accuracy without effort.** |
| **5. Payment and Waiting** | They make the payment and wait for their drink to be prepared amidst the crowd. | **Neutral 😐.** <br> *It's a purely transactional step, but the wait can be uncomfortable.* | - **Streamline payment and minimize waiting time at the bar.** |
| **6. Consumption** | They return to their table or space, if it's still available, to have their drink. | **Positive 😊.** <br> *Feels relieved to finally have their drink.* | - |

## 6. Brainstorming Process and Derived Solution

### Brainstorming

Based on the pain points identified in the Journey Map, our team focused on solving the most critical customer frustrations. We used the **"How Might We...?"** technique to guide ideation:

* **How might we** allow a customer to order without feeling the need to leave their table and belongings?
* **How might we** create an ordering system that doesn't rely on verbal communication in a noisy environment?
* **How might we** make the payment and pickup process as fast and seamless as possible to minimize time spent in the congested bar area?

The most promising idea was a digital solution that would centralize the ordering and payment process on the user's device, directly addressing the problems of security, communication, and efficiency.

### Derived Solution: The "CounterPass" App

The solution is a mobile application designed to transform the purchasing experience in crowded venues. The features of **CounterPass** directly respond to the needs identified in the analysis:

1.  **Digital Menu and Remote Ordering:** The customer can view the full menu, select their items, and place the order directly from their phone, from anywhere in the establishment. This completely eliminates the **security dilemma** of having to leave their table or group.

2.  **In-App Integrated Payment:** The application allows for secure payment with credit/debit cards or other payment gateways. This streamlines the transaction and reduces reliance on handling cash or card machines at the bar.

3.  **QR Code Pickup System:** Upon payment confirmation, the app generates a unique QR code for the order. The customer receives a notification when their order is ready and heads to a quick pickup point or "CounterPass Lane." There, they simply show the QR code for instant verification and receive their order. This system solves the problem of **verbal communication in noisy environments** and makes delivery fast and error-free.
